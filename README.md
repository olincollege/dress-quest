## README

# Summary
This repository contains code for our project Dress Quest, an interactive dress up and platformer game. In the first part, you can use the arrow keys to select an outfit for your frog. Then, your dream outfit is blown away, and you must embark on a quest to retrieve it. This quest takes the form of a platformer, where you use the arrow keys to control your frog jumping up through the rainforest until you are able to reach your dream outfit. 

# Controls
The dress up game is controlled using the left and right arrow keys to scroll between items of clothing, and the up and down arrow keys to change which item of clothing you're changing (hat, top, or bottom). The platformer is controlled with the left and right arrow keys moving the frog back and forth, and the up button to jump. 

# How to Run
You can download the code for our project from this [git repository](https://github.com/olincollege/dress-quest.git), either by cloning the repository to your computer or downloading the ZIP. To run this code, you will first need to install one additional package, pygame. This package can be installed via pip, by typing ```python -m pip install pygame``` into your terminal. Once pygame is installed, you can run the project by navigating into the folder containing the code from this repository and typing ```python main.py``` into your terminal.
