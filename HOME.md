<h3> Welcome to Dress Quest! </h3> 
The game is made of two main stages. In the first (pictured below), players get to dress up their frog. <br>
A variety of hats, tops, and bottoms are available to choose from to form their dream outfit. <br>

Once the player finished their outfit, however, they lose their clothes. <br>
They must jump through a series of randomly generated platforms and climb a tree where they will win back their clothes. <br>
