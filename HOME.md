Welcome to Dress Quest!
The game is made of two main stages. In the first (pictured below), players get to dress up their frog. A variety of hats, tops, and bottoms are available to choose from to form their dream outfit.

Once the player finished their outfit, however, they lose their clothes. They must jump through a series of randomly generated platforms and climb a tree where they will win back their clothes.
